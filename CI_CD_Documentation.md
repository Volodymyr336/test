# CI/CD Documentation for GitHub Actions

This document explains the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline set up using GitHub Actions in this repository. It describes the workflow, tools, and processes to ensure a smooth and automated build, test, and deployment process.

---

## **Overview**
GitHub Actions is configured to:
- Automatically run tests and build the project on every `push` to the `main` branch.
- Execute workflows on every `pull_request` to the `main` branch.
- Notify developers of pipeline success or failure.

The pipeline ensures code quality and readiness for deployment by automating:
1. **Code Checkout**
2. **Dependency Installation**
3. **Automated Testing**

---

## **Workflow File**
The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

### **Workflow YAML Configuration**
Below is the current configuration of the workflow:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

---

## **Workflow Steps Explanation**

### 1. **Trigger Events**
   - **`push`:** The pipeline runs whenever new code is pushed to the `main` branch.
   - **`pull_request`:** The pipeline runs on pull requests targeting the `main` branch.

### 2. **Job: Build**
   - **`runs-on`:** Specifies the runner environment (Ubuntu Linux).

   #### Steps:
   - **Checkout repository:**
     Uses the `actions/checkout` action to pull the latest code from the repository.
   
   - **Setup Node.js:**
     Sets up a Node.js environment using version 20.

   - **Install dependencies:**
     Installs all project dependencies specified in `package.json` using `npm install`.

   - **Run tests:**
     Executes the test suite with `npm test`. Test results are displayed in the logs.

## **Extending the Pipeline**

### **1. Adding Deployment**
To add deployment to the workflow (e.g., deploying to a server or cloud provider):
```yaml
      - name: Deploy to Production
        run: |
          echo "Deploying application..."
          # Add deployment commands here
```

### **2. Code Coverage Reports**
You can integrate tools like Coveralls or Codecov to track code coverage:
```yaml
      - name: Upload Coverage to Codecov
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
```

### **3. Notifications**
To notify developers via Slack or email:
```yaml
      - name: Notify Slack
        uses: slackapi/slack-github-action@v1.23.0
        with:
          payload: '{"text":"CI Pipeline completed!"}'
          slack-bot-token: ${{ secrets.SLACK_BOT_TOKEN }}
```

## **Best Practices**
1. **Use Secrets for Sensitive Data:**
   - Store sensitive data like API keys or tokens in GitHub Secrets (Settings > Secrets and Variables).

2. **Keep Workflows Modular:**
   - Break down complex pipelines into reusable workflows using the `workflow_call` feature.

3. **Test Locally Before Committing:**
   - Use tools like `act` to test GitHub Actions locally.

4. **Monitor Pipeline Metrics:**
   - Regularly review the Actions tab for pipeline health and execution times.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues:
1. **Permission Denied Errors:**
   - Ensure the GitHub runner has access to required secrets.

2. **Dependency Installation Fails:**
   - Check `package.json` and lock files for inconsistencies.

3. **Pipeline Hanging:**
   - Review logs to identify the step causing delays.
